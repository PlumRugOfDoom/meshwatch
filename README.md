# meshtalk
MeshTalk is a python3 program that will allow you to send and receive messages from python. The messages are decoded and displayed in a text based interface created with Curses.

I built this project with the goal of learning about the Meshtastic API and to get used to using new development tools such as Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
